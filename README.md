# Australian Energy – Generation and Usage
A study of historical Australian fossil fuel and renewable energy generation and usage.

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyse historical Australian energy/electricity generation and usage data from the <b>1970s to present</b>, and identify potential trends based on the use of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.

## Analysis
The study utilised a variety of datasets taken from the <b>Australian Government's Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources</b> website. The datasets observed electrical and energy generation and usage by <b>state, fuel-type, energy source, consumption, productivity and trade (imports and exports).</b>

### Generation

During the period of <b>2019–20</b>, the total generation of electricity came from a variety of fuel-types and energy sources. These included fossil fuels, such as <b>coal, natural gas</b> and <b>oil</b>, and renewable sources including <b>hydro-electricity</b> and <b>solar.</b>

</p>

As is evident in the chart above, during the period of <b>2019–20</b> the states along <b>Austrlaia's eastern seaboard (NSW, VIC and QLD),</b> with the inclusion of <b>WA</b> continued to generate a <b>majority of their electricity from coal.</b> This is in <i>contrast</i> to <b>SA, TAS and NT,</b> who generated a <b>majority of their electricity from renewables, hydro-electricity and natural gas, respectively.</b> 

Overall, during the <b>2019–20</b> period the <b>majority of electricity in Australia was generated using coal,</b> with natural gas the second-highest fuel-type.

</p>

However, the chart above tells a slightly different story. Although coal was used to generate a majority of Australia's electricity in <b>2019–20</b>, since <b>1994</b> our reliance on coal as a fuel-type used for electiricty generation has <b>continued to decline,</b> reaching an <b>historical low in 2020</b>. 

Although great news for our environment, since 1994 there has been an <b>upward trend in our reliance on natural gas as a major fuel-type used for electricity generation.</b>

</p>

The chart above outlines state electricity generation by sector during the <b>2019–20</b> period. Overall, around <b>84%</b> of Australia's electricity generation during this time was generated by the <b>electricity sector</b>, while the remaining <b>16%</b> was generated by <b>mining, manufacturing and other industries and households.</b> 

This share varies considerably across states and territories, with the non-electricity sector contributing over <b>40%</b> of total generation in <b>WA and NT</b> but only <b>3% in Tasmania.</b>


### Usage

Furthermore, during the 2019–20 period the share of energy use by fuel-type varied dramatically.

</p>

As evident in the chart above, the eastern seaborn states of <b>NSW, VIC and QLD</b> continued to use electricity generated by fossil fuel sources such as coal and oil. Conversely, <b>TAS</b> – a state which generated a majority of its electricity from renewable sources – used an increasing amount of energy from renewable sources.

</p>

As observed in the chart above, historically there has been a overwhelming reliance on coal and oil as Australia's primary source of electricity/energy generation and usage. 

In addition, the use of gas for electricity generation and use continues to climb at a higher rate compared to coal and oil. This rate is not surprising, and correlates in-line with the <b>Morrison Government's</b> more-recent <i>'gas-led recovery'</i> policy and energy outlook.

</p>

Comparatively, the use of renewable energy sources has <b>continued to rise over the past number of decades.</b> As observed, although hydro-electricity continues to be the most used renewable energy source, in recent years there has been a <b>sharp increase in the use of wind energy and solar,</b> which may be contributed to the growing uptake of residential and commercial solar systems.

</p>

Interestingly however, our reliance on bioenergy has continued to be non-existant, with the cumulative usage rate remaining relatively stable when compared to both wind energy and solar. 

### Trade
#### Imports

In 2019–20, Australia imported around double the amount of refined products compared to international crude oil/ORF, and imported around <b>200 petajoules</b> of natural gas.

</p>

#### Exports

Comparitively, during the same period Australia exported over <b>10,000 petajoules of coal, over 4,000 petajoules of natural gas,</b> and a considerably smaller amount of coal/ORF and refined products of overseas nations.

#### Energy Balance

Historically, there has been a relatively consistent trend in the ratios of energy production, consumption and net exports. Additionally, of the total energy produced, Australia continues to export more than we consume.

#### Energy Productivity

</p>

In 2019-20, the Australian economy <b>contracted by 0.3% to $1.9 trillion</b>. Additionally, energy consumption <b>fell by 2.9% to 6,014 PJ.</b>

Energy productivity (gross domestic product (GDP) divided by energy consumption) <b>improved by 2.7%,</b> and by <b>21% over the past ten years.</b> Australia now creates <b>$324 million in GDP for every petajoule of energy consumed,</b> over <b>$50 million more than a decade ago.</b>

This improvement reflects cumulative improvements in energy efficiency as well as a shift in the economy away from highly energy-intensive industries like manufacturing, towards less energy-intensive industries such as services. Increased use of renewable energy instead of combustion-based generation sources for electricity generation has also had a positive impact on energy productivity.
