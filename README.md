# Australian Energy – Generation and Usage
A study of historical Australian fossil fuel and rewneable energy generation and usage.

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyse historical Australian energy/electricity generation and usage data from the <b>1970s to present</b>, and identify potential trends based on the use of fossil fuels and renewable energy sources.

## Analysis
The study utilised a variety of datasets taken from the <b>Australian Government's Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources</b> website. The datasets observed electrical and energy generation and usage by <b>state, fuel-type, energy source, consumption, productivity and trade (imports and exports).</b>

### Generation

During the period of <b>2019–20</b>, the generation of electricity came from a variety of fuel-types and energy sources. These included fossil fuels, such as <b>coal, natural gas</b> and <b>oil</b>, and renewable sources including <b>hydro-electricity</b> and <b>solar.</b>

As is evident in the chart above, during the period of <b>2019–20</b> the states along <b>Austrlaia's eastern seaboard (NSW, VIC and QLD),</b> with the inclusion of <b>WA</b> continued to generate a <b>majority of their electricity from coal.</b> This is in <i>contrast</i> to <b>SA, TAS and NT,</b> who generated a <b>majority of their electricity from renewables, hydro-electricity and natural gas, respectively.</b> 

Overall, during the <b>2019–20</b> period the <b>majority of electricity in Australia was generated using coal,</b> with natural gas the second-highest fuel-type.

However, the chart above tells a slightly different story. Although coal was used to generate a majority of Australia's electricity in <b>2019–20</b>, since <b>1994</b> our reliance on coal as a fuel-type used for electiricty generation has <b>continued to decline,</b> reaching an <b>historical low in 2020</b>. 

Although great news for our environment, since 1994 there has been an <b>upward trend in our reliance on natural gas as a major fuel-type used for electricity generation.</b>

The chart above outlines state electricity generation by sector during the <b>2019–20</b> period. Overall, around <b>84%</b> of Australia's electricity generation during this time was generated by the <b>electricity sector</b>, while the remaining <b>16%</b> was generated by <b>mining, manufacturing and other industries and households.</b> 

This share varies considerably across states and territories, with the non-electricity sector contributing over <b>40%</b> of total generation in <b>WA and NT</b> but only <b>3% in Tasmania.</b>
